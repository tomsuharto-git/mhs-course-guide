      "The CBI program is for students with significant disabilities ages 18-21. The students' IEP team will consider participation in the CBI program after the student has met their graduation requirements unless the target group to be served has significant disabilities and may need an alternative program. They will remain in high school with a desire to engage in the program requirements as set by the school district and advisory team. The IEP team must consider the postsecondary goals of each student and determine if the student's individual needs will be addressed through such a program. The CBI program facilitates connections to community options and will provide opportunities to become a part of the community. It may also facilitate connections to training programs. The Montclair Transition Program provides students who have individualized education plans (IEP's) the opportunity to gain the life skills and confidence to become active, productive and welcome citizens in their local communities. Our program activities are comprehensive and include instruction in several areas; however, a substantial emphasis is on employment preparation.",
