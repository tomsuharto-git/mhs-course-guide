      'This beginning course covers the fundamentals of grammar and vocabulary, and teaches, in a functional way, the inflections and principles of grammar needed for reading and translating simple Latin stories. The present tense is studied for verbs of the first, second, third, and fourth conjugations together with nouns of the first, second, and third declensions and adjectives of the first and second declensions. Translations of edited Latin stories give a background of Roman life, history and mythology. Skills in English are developed through a study of the contribution of Latin to our vocabulary. Students give oral presentations on aspects of Roman daily life as well as work on group projects for visual presentations.',
