      'Music Theory I introduces students to the fundamental concepts of music theory, sight-singing, and basic piano skills, building a comprehensive foundation for further study in music and transitioning into AP Theory. This course emphasizes understanding musical notation, rhythm, intervals, scales, key signatures, and chords, while also developing ear training skills and sight-singing abilities. Students will engage in practical exercises that connect theory to practice, including basic piano activities to reinforce theoretical knowledge and improve musical dexterity. By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of musical structures, enhanced aural skills, and beginner-level piano proficiency, preparing them for more advanced studies in music. Students will not be required to read music to enter this class.',

Areas covered include: analysis of rhythm and the measurement of time, notation of pitch through major/minor scales and keys, intervals, chords, transposition, modulation, musical forms and styles. In addition, emphasis is placed on the creative process through composition, transcription, and arranging. Time is spent on ear training through singing, rhythmic and melodic dictation and keyboard skills. Use of computer programs to develop musical skills comprises one-half of the course. A music notation program is used to complete projects. This course culminates in a final project consisting of an original composition, a transcription or an arrangement.
